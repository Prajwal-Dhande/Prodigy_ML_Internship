## 🚀 Task 1: House Price Prediction

### 📌 Overview
The objective of this task was to create a machine learning model that predicts the price of a house based on its specific features.

**Dataset:** [Kaggle - House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data)

### 🛠 Technologies Used
* **Python**
* **Pandas** (Data Manipulation)
* **Scikit-learn** (Model Training & Evaluation)
* **Matplotlib/Seaborn** (Data Visualization)

### 📊 Methodology
1.  **Data Loading:** Loaded the dataset directly from the source.
2.  **Data Cleaning:** Selected relevant features (`GrLivArea`, `BedroomAbvGr`, `FullBath`) and handled missing values.
3.  **Model Selection:** Used **Linear Regression** as the baseline model.
4.  **Evaluation:** Assessed performance using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **R-squared (R²)** scores.

### 📈 Results
* The model successfully predicts house prices with a reasonable degree of accuracy based on the selected features.
* A visualization of **Actual vs. Predicted Prices** shows a linear relationship, confirming the model's effectiveness.
