# 🛍️ Task 2: Customer Segmentation (K-Means Clustering)

**Prodigy Infotech Internship - Machine Learning Track**

### 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a **K-Means Clustering** algorithm to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history.

The goal is to segregate customers into distinct groups (clusters) using the **Mall Customers Dataset**, allowing the store to target specific customer segments with personalized marketing strategies.

### 📊 Model Output
Below is the visualization of the customer segments. The **Elbow Method** determined that **5 clusters** was the optimal number of groups.
