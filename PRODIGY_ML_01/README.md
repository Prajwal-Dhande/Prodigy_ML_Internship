# 🏠 Task 1: House Price Prediction (Linear Regression)

**Prodigy Infotech Internship - Machine Learning Track**

### 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a **Linear Regression** model to predict house prices based on specific features such as square footage (`GrLivArea`), number of bedrooms (`BedroomAbvGr`), and number of bathrooms (`FullBath`).

The goal is to understand the relationship between these features and the final sale price using the **Kaggle House Prices dataset**.

### 📊 Model Output
Below is the visualization of the model's performance, comparing the **Actual Prices** vs. the **Predicted Prices**. The red line represents a perfect prediction; the closer the blue dots are to the line, the more accurate the model.

### 🛠 Technologies Used
* **Python**
* **Pandas** (Data Manipulation)
* **Scikit-learn** (Model Training & Evaluation)
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (Data Visualization)
* **Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab**

### 📂 Dataset
* **Source:** [Kaggle - House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data)
* **Method:** The dataset is loaded directly via a raw GitHub URL to bypass Kaggle authentication requirements for smoother execution in Colab.

### 🚀 How to Run
1.  Open the file `PRODIGY_ML_01` in this repository.
2.  Click the "Open in Colab" button (if available) or download the file to run it locally.
3.  Run all cells to see the data processing, training, and prediction steps.
